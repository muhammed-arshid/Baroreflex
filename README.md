#Cardiac Baroreflex 
Quantifies cardiac baroreflex sensitivity from raw ecg and continuous blood pressure signals


ECG QRS peaks are detected to calculate RR interval. Beat-to-beat systolic, mean and diastolic blood pressure calculated (Green, red and light blue lines)

Relationship between RR interval and Systolic Blood Pressure. Slope of linear regression is representative of baroreflex sensitivity. Each data point is the mean of a 3mmHg pressure bin.
